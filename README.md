1. In the expenses project, the expenseUI module we bind the function with this keyword, becasue we are using addEvent Listiners. like callBack function
2. this.elements.addUserForm.addEventListener("submit", this.handleAddUser.bind(this));  actually we didnt wrote code like this (bind) but we wrote the like this
this.elements.addUserForm.addEventListener("submit", (e) =>
    this.handleAddUser(e)
);
Why no .bind(this) is needed here?
You are not passing this.handleAddUser directly.

Instead, you’re passing an arrow function:

(e) => this.handleAddUser(e)
👉 Arrow functions don’t create their own this.
They “capture” the this from the surrounding scope — in this case, the surrounding scope is inside your ExpenseUI class instance.

So inside that arrow function, this still points to your ExpenseUI object.
Then, when you call this.handleAddUser(e), it works correctly.

1. How this works in classes

In JavaScript classes, this is not automatically preserved when you pass a method around.

Inside the class method definition, this refers to the class instance.

But when you pass that method as a callback (e.g., to addEventListener), the function is invoked later by some other object (like the DOM element), and this may no longer be your class instance.

That’s why we sometimes need to explicitly bind the method to the instance (this.method.bind(this)).
===========================================================================

you’ve spotted something that often confuses people about when objects (like this.elements) are created, and how this binding interacts with them. Let’s walk through this step by step.

1. Where this.elements comes from ?
   ans)===>
   this.elements exists because initializeElements() is called in the constructor before bindEvents(). Binding (.bind(this)) doesn’t create this.elements — it only ensures the event handler uses the correct this (the class instance) when accessing properties like this.elements
